## About this lab

[Kubernetes Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) is an API resource that allows you manage external or internal HTTP(S) access to Kubernetes services running in a cluster. [Amazon Elastic Load Balancing Application Load Balancer (ALB)](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/features/#Details_for_Elastic_Load_Balancing_Products) is a popular AWS service that load balances incoming traffic at the application layer (layer 7) across multiple targets. The lab walks through the steps of setting up ALB Ingress controller, deploying sample applicatoin (2048 game) and exposing the application publicly via ALB.

## How Kubernetes Ingress works with [aws-alb-ingress-controller](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-alb-ingress-controller)

The following diagram details the AWS components that the aws-alb-ingress-controller creates whenever an Ingress resource is defined by the user. The Ingress resource routes ingress traffic from the Application Load Balancer(ALB) to the Kubernetes cluster.

## Setup

If you are trying this lab from AWS Submit, the lab would have been set up for you. Please proceed to [Connect to Cloud 9](#connect-to-cloud9). Otherwise, please follow [setup guide](setup/README.md) in setup folder.

## <a name="connect-to-cloud9"></a> Connect to Cloud 9

* Open [AWS Cloud 9 Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/home)
* Find the environment that has *EKSCloud9* as prefix in title and *DevLab EKS ALB 2048 Game Cloud9 environment* in description.
* Click *Open IDE* button.
* Complete the following steps in Cloud 9 to finish the lab.

## Step 0

In Cloud 9 environment, maximize the Terminal, and load the profile with this command:

```
source ~/.bash_profile
``` 

## Step 1

Create a Kubernetes service account named alb-ingress-controller in the kube-system namespace, a cluster role, and a cluster role binding for the ALB Ingress Controller to use with the following command.

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-alb-ingress-controller/v1.1.4/docs/examples/rbac-role.yaml
```

## Step 2: 

Deploy the ALB Ingress Controller with the following command

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-alb-ingress-controller/v1.1.4/docs/examples/alb-ingress-controller.yaml
```

## Step 3:

ALB Ingress Controller needs to know the EKS cluster name. Open the ALB Ingress Controller deployment manifest for editing with the following command

```
kubectl edit deployment.apps/alb-ingress-controller -n kube-system
```

Add a line for the cluster name after the --ingress-class=alb line.

```
spec:
  containers:
  - args:
    - --ingress-class=alb
    - --cluster-name=eks-alb-2048game
```

Save the file and exit will trigger ALB Ingress Controller pod to redeploy.

## Step 4:

Confirm that the ALB Ingress Controller is running with the following command. 

```
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
```

Expected output:

```
NAME                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
alb-ingress-controller-55b5bbcb5b-bc8q9   1/1     Running   0          56s
```

## Step 5:

Create a namespace for 2048 game.

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-alb-ingress-controller/v1.1.4/docs/examples/2048/2048-namespace.yaml
```

Verify the namespace has been created:

```
kubectl get ns
```

Expected output:

```
NAME              STATUS   AGE
2048-game         Active   42h
default           Active   42h
kube-node-lease   Active   42h
kube-public       Active   42h
kube-system       Active   42h
```

## Step 6:

Create a deployment to run 2048 game application pods.

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-alb-ingress-controller/v1.1.4/docs/examples/2048/2048-deployment.yaml
```

Verify the deployment has been created:

```
kubectl get deployment -n 2048-game
```

Expected output:

```
NAME              READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
2048-deployment   5/5     5            5           42h
```

## Step 7:

Create a service to abstract 2048 game application pods.

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-alb-ingress-controller/v1.1.4/docs/examples/2048/2048-service.yaml
```

Verify the service has been created:

```
kubectl get service -n 2048-game
```

Expected output:

```
NAME           TYPE       CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
service-2048   NodePort   10.100.49.101   <none>        80:32667/TCP   42h
```

## Step 8:

Deploy ALB Ingress resource to expose 2048 Game via AWS Application Load Balancer.

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-alb-ingress-controller/v1.1.4/docs/examples/2048/2048-ingress.yaml
```

After a few minutes, verify that the Ingress resource was created with the following command. 

```
kubectl get ingress/2048-ingress -n 2048-game
```

Expected output:

```
NAME           HOSTS   ADDRESS                                                                     PORTS   AGE
2048-ingress   *       7dfe79d3-2048game-2048ingr-6fa0-35333457.ap-southeast-2.elb.amazonaws.com   80      41h
```

To debug, run the following command to view the Ingress controller log:

```
kubectl logs -n kube-system   deployment.apps/alb-ingress-controller
```

## Step 9:

Navigate to [AWS Console Load Balancer page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home#LoadBalancers:sort=loadBalancerName) to see the Load Balancer created by ALB Ingress Controller according to the Ingress resource.

## Step 10:

Open a browser and navigate to the ALB endpoint (shown in ADDRESS field from the previous command `kubectl get ingress/2048-ingress -n 2048-game` output or from AWS Load Balancer Console) to see the 2048 game application.

## Step 11:

When you finish experimenting with the lab, delete it with the following commands.

```
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-alb-ingress-controller/v1.1.4/docs/examples/2048/2048-ingress.yaml
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-alb-ingress-controller/v1.1.4/docs/examples/2048/2048-service.yaml
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-alb-ingress-controller/v1.1.4/docs/examples/2048/2048-deployment.yaml
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-alb-ingress-controller/v1.1.4/docs/examples/2048/2048-namespace.yaml
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-alb-ingress-controller/v1.1.4/docs/examples/alb-ingress-controller.yaml
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-alb-ingress-controller/v1.1.4/docs/examples/rbac-role.yaml
```
